Rules of Hex:
There are two players.
The board is an array of hexagons
--- some number of rows and some number of columns ---
in the shape of a parallelogram.
Two opposing sides are black.
Two opposing sides are white.

One player gets the black sides
and a set of black stones or a black marker.
The other player gets the white sides
and a set of white stones or a white marker.
Players alternate turns.
On a turn, a player puts a stone --- or marks --- an empty cell.
The winner is the player who connects their two sides
with a path --- which can twist and turn.
